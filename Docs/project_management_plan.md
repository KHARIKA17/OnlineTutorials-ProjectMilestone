### Risk Identification:
The risk identification was conducted in the initial project risk assessment meeting.Crawford Slip method was used by the project team to the identify risks.

### Risk Analysis and Evaluation:
We have to analyze the risks identified to determine what effects that have on a project like delayed time or reduced quality.The risks are also evaluated for probability and impact.

### Risk Response Planning:
The process for conducting response planning to address both negative and positive risks including how a project team will develop actions will e explained.

### Risk Mitigation:
This process is defined as the steps taken to reduce the adverse effects.

### Risk Monitoring:
The greatest impacts of risks are added to the project plan to make sure that they are monitored during the time the project is exposed to each risk.


### Risk Register:
The Risk Register is a log of all risks identified, the impact to the project, to which category they belong to, mitigation strategy, and when the risk will e occurred in this project.
