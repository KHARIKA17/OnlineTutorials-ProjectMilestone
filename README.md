## Working as a team together:
As a team we are not going to let anyone and anything down in project. Everyone in the team are supportive to the other individuals. The weakness we have as an individual are not visible as we have other members to cover them.

## Team meetings:
We will daily meet evening in Colden hall for the status of project to help each other if anyone fall behind. 

## Contacting each other: 
We will be communicating using Northwest Email and Skype for Business to have quick online meetings. 

## Dealing with a non-participating team member:
In one team everyone are interested to learn new things and want to help others. So there is no such thing like not participating. Due to some personal or health issues if they are not participating for some time, we always got their back and never let them fall down.
